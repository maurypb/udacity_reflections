What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This initializes the repository, with no tracked files.  Without this, the structure that will keep track of them is not created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where the current version's changes are kept...? and when you commit them, they are added to the repository.
