reflections for lesson 3
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you'd like to collaborate with other authors, or just have all your work available " on the cloud" anywhere you wish to work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are in a collaborative environment, you might only want to push when you are sure you'd like a version to be made public.
